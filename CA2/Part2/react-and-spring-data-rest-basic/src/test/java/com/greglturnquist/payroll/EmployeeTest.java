/**
 * Unit tests for the Employee class to ensure proper instantiation and validation.
 * Each test method validates a specific scenario of creating an employee instance.
 * Tests cover various cases including valid input, null values, empty strings, whitespace, and negative job years.
 * Additionally, tests check for valid email addresses.
 * These tests help ensure the correctness of the Employee class's behavior and validation logic.
