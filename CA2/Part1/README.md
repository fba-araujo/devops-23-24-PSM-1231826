## Part 1
The goal is to practice using graddle.

### Step 1: Downloading and Committing the example application

    % git clone https://bitbucket.org/pssmatos/gradle_basic_demo.git

### Step 2: Execute the server
Changed my Gradle distribution to version 8.5

Updated gradle-wrapper.properties
``` properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip
```

    % cd ca2/part1/gradle_basic_demo

Build
-----
    % ./gradlew build 

Run the server
--------------
    % java -cp build/libs/basic_demo-0.1.0.jar basic_demo.ChatServerApp 59001

Run two clients
------------
    % ./gradlew runClient

### Step 3: Simple unit test
Added the following test to App.java
```java
/*
 * This Java source file was generated by the Gradle 'init' task.
 */

package basic_demo;

import org.junit.Test;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

/**
 * This is a test class for the {@link App} class.
 */
public class AppTest {
    /**
     * Test to verify that the {@link App} class has a greeting.
     */
    @Test
    public void testAppHasAGreeting() {
        App classUnderTest = new App();

        String greeting = classUnderTest.getGreeting();

        assertNotNull("App should have a greeting", greeting);
    }
}
```
And added the following dependency to graddle script

    implementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
